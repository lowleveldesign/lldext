# LLD extension

My WinDbg extension. I plan to implement in it various commands that I find useful.

Currently contains the following commands:

- `!injectdll <path>` - injects DLL into the debuggee

Current version can be found under the release tab - use version corresponding to the bitness of the debuggee.
